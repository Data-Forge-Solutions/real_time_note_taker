# real_time_note_taker

A terminal user interface application for taking timestamped notes in real time. The bottom of the interface lists the active key bindings. By default press `Enter` to begin a note, type your text, and press `Enter` again to save. Press `s` to start a section and enter a title. Use the arrow keys to navigate through existing entries and press `e` to edit one. Press `Esc` to cancel an entry. Press `w` to save all notes to a file and `l` to load from a file. Files are saved in CSV format under a platformâ€‘appropriate directory shown in the prompt and created automatically if it does not exist. Quit the application with `q`. Use `--file <PATH>` to load and save notes automatically.

Key bindings can be customized by constructing the [`App`] with [`KeyBindings`](src/app.rs) using `App::with_keybindings` or by calling `App::set_keybindings`.

When loading, an overlay window lists the files in this directory for selection.
